// Version - v1.0 (It will be easier for debugging)

// (Works)   -   100% It is works
// (Placebo) -   May be it works or not (but some commands works suddenly like cl_drawmonitors)
//               Add "//" infront of the commands to no effect 
//               Remove "//" infront of the commands to take effect
//               You will see differences even though i marked it as Placebo
// (Testing) -   Testing which value is better (current values are better than default)
// (Reduce)  -   Reduce number of things or reduce the quality

// Gameplay Settings                             - I recommend not to change anything (Read info about all commands)
// Color Settings - IMPORTANT!                   - This works great for me (Helps a lot in outside zone fights)
// Utility And Binds - IMPORTANT!                - Advanced Users Only - Remove "//" infront of the commands to take effect (Read info about all commands)
// Personal Settings                             - Remove "//" infront of the commands to take effect (Feel free to change)

// Audio Settings - IMPORTANT!                   - I recommend not to change (Only change 1st and 2nd command value to 8 if you have 7.1 headsets) - 2 [stereo] 6 [5.1] 8 [7.1]
// Low Latency - IMPORTANT!                      - I recommend not to change (Only change last 3 commands value) (Read it properly)
// Connection Settings                           - I recommend not to change anything
